# CA_sprint4_airbnb

Final Sprint (4) where we used what we learned in the past 3 months to create a dummy Airbnb pixel perfect site.

A little over three months after writing our first console.log('hello world'), We took on the challenge of building an Airbnb clone in 10 days. To do so we used the diversity of skills we learned and developed over the course. The tools we used included:

BASE:

- HTML, CSS, & JS
- React (frontend framework)
- Awesome custom react hooks (check scr/customHooks)
- Node.js
- Socket.io (Websockets)
- middlewares(backend)
- MongoDb (database)

Additional:

- React-Redux (State-Management)
- Eventbus
- PWA (via Service Worker + responsive design)

Design and assets:
