Walking from the subway after dark was a little daunting but we remained safe. We did catch a cab a few times from Manhattan as it was very late.

We preferred heading up to broadway to catch our trains (Depending where we were going) only because it was much more pleasant on sunny days to be above grounds if we could. It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana",

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n",

Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned.

The area is not very posh, but, for me, it feels like home, so I tend to stay there whenever I go to New York. The listing description was accurate enough, with respect to the way the apartment looks. If you can't deal with noise at night, however, this might not be the place for you. The neighbors were surprisingly noisy in the wee hours of the night and virtually silent during the day. This apartment is close to the subway, which was very useful.",

También fue muy comprensivo para acordar el check out de acuerdo a la hora que fue más conveniente para nosotros, aún cuando también se nos hizo tarde. Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros. Una sugerencia sería poner un espejo de cuerpo completo en alguna parte del apartento. En resumen, el apartamento fue perfecto para nosotros, nos volveríamos a quedar y claro que lo recomendaría!

It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building. There're always locals hanging out in front but we were never bothered.

Thank you Nihat. \nRegarding the apartment, it is exactly as described. The room is nice and bed is comfortable. It was clean and well prepared for us. \nRegarding the neighborhood, it is very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Street with few minutes walk. As normal as it is in Istanbul, there is a short hill you need to walk to get to the square, which was totally fine with us. \n\nIn general, next time I visit Istanbul I would first check the availability with Nihat before searching others.',
